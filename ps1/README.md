## Problem 1
Problem 1 focused on getting 802.11 packet information by putting a wireless
card in monitor mode and catching the packets with wireshark.

The output of this problem are several scripts to catch packets and use the

are a picture of a chart generated, a screenshot of wireshark with beacon
packets displaying, and a csv of packets stored from the script.

Done by Nick Jones.
