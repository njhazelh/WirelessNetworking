The data for the RSSI-to-LoS graph was gathered manually by walking from the 
closest to farthest locations where the access point was still within my line of 
sight. I took measurements at critical points (doorways, slight corners), so this
is why the measurements are not a uniform one-per-x-feet.

NOTE: my current file naming is bad because i made my distance notes really weirdly.
i'll fix them next commit
