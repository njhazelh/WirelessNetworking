This script is used to parse the output from the lua script in tshark.  The
benefit of this is that we can filter out any unexpected output from tshark
and we can combine the information over time.  This could have been done in
lua, but python is a much nicer language.

    The way this works is by keeping a view of the world and a view

    If an access point does not appear in the interval, but we expected it,
    it gets penalized harshly.  APs that fall below -10dbm are removed from
    the view of the world.  At the end of each interval, the view of the
