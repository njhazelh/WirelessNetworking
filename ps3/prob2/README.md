# PS 3: Problem 2: FM Radio Receiver
Part 2 involved creating a FM radio receiver and a tool to play recorded
audio at different speeds.

## Inventory:
- images/* : various images of our results.  Used by report.md.
- audio_playback.py : Python script generated by prob2_playback.grc
- fm_radio.py : Python script generated by prob2.grc
- prob2_playback.grc : Flowchart for playing audio from prob2.grc
- prob2.grc : Flowchart for listening to FM Radio
- radio_recording_2.wav : Wav output from prob2_playback.grc.  Should be
    similar to radio_recording.wav but slowed or sped up.
- radio_recording.wav : Wav output from prob2.grc. Same as radio_samples but
    playable.
- radio_samples : Audio signals from prob2.grc, read by prob2_playback.grc
- README.md : This file

## How to run:
To run this code, you will need a HackRF One or similar device.

Open the flowcharts in gnuradio-companion.
Run the pre-generated scripts using python.
